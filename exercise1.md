Letâ€™s say our team is working on a Java program.

In Java, the most common lint tools are Checkstyle and SpotBugs. These tools help us keep our code clean and easy to read. They can also find some bugs before we run the program. For testing, we use JUnit and Mockito. JUnit helps us write unit tests, and Mockito is good for mocking objects. These tools are widely used and well-supported in the Java community. For building, we use Maven, which is a powerful tool to manage project dependencies and build the final software package.

When it comes to CI, I think we can choose tools like GitLab CI or Travis CI. These tools work well with many version control systems. Which one we choose depends on where we store our code. All of them use YAML files to define the steps, so if we want to change platforms later, it will be easy.

Finally, I prefer to use a cloud-based CI tool like GitHub Actions. Our team is small and does not have much time to set up and maintain local servers. Cloud CI tools reduce this extra work and allow us to focus on writing code. They also make it easier for everyone to work together.
